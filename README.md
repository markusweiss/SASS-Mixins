# My Sass mixin library

Feel free to use or commentate.

### Here i start collecting the Sass mixins i use:

* [add-font](mixins/_add-font.scss)
* [text-with-ellipsis (â€¦)](mixins/_text-with-ellipsis.scss)


### Documentation

How to use the mixin can be found in the header.

In your main.scss import the mixin `@import "add-font.scss";`.
