# My Sass mixin library

Feel free to use or commentate.

### Here i start collecting the Sass mixins i use:

* [add-font](mixins/_add-font.scss)
* [from-to-animation](mixins/_from-to-animation.scss)
* [text-with-ellipsis (â€¦)](mixins/_text-with-ellipsis.scss)


### Documentation

How to use the mixin can be found in the header.

In your main.scss import the mixin:

`@import "mixins-folder/_add-font.scss";`

`@import "mixins-folder/_from_to_animation.scss";`

`@import "mixins-folder/_text-with-ellipsis.scss";`
